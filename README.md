# Crux Tutorial

Official Crux "Space Adventure" Tutorial

## Quickstart

* Read the tutorial: https://nextjournal.com/crux-tutorial/
* Try online: https://nextjournal.com/try/crux-tutorial/

## Install Tutorial on Nextjournal

The Quickstart is the easiest way to run the tutorial and you can use the Nextjournal
"Remix" feature to bring the tutorial into your own Nextjournal Clojure notebooks if you
like. However, you can import the Markdown files in this repository directly, if you would
prefer.

1. Create a new account on [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com).
2. Download a Markdown file from this repository root.
3. Click "+ NEW" to create a new notebook on the [Nextjournal Dashboard](https://nextjournal.com/dashboard).
4. At the bottom of the page, choose "Import: Select a Markdown file to import" and upload the `.md` file you downloaded in Step 2.
Do not use "Import from a (GitHub) URL" -- it will not work.
5. Once imported, scroll down to the EDN block which begins with `{:deps ...` under "Runtime Setup".
Hover your cursor over this EDN block and an ellipsis ("...") will appear on the lefthand side.
Click the ellipsis.
Choose "Assign Name" and enter `deps.edn`.
6. Open the Clojure Runtime Settings by clicking "Runtimes: Clojure" in the lefthand sidebar.
Scroll down to "Mounts" and click "+ Add mount".
Select `deps.edn`.
Click "Save changes and start" in the dialog that appears at the top.

You can now run the tutorial notebook.

## Reinstallation (for maintainers)

For now, the Nextjournal notebooks are the golden store for the Space Adventure tutorial.
As such, you should edit a Nextjournal notebook by following these steps:

1. Edit the notebook directly in Nextjournal
2. Select "Share: Publish Changes" to republish it
3. Select "Editor => Export => Export As Markdown" from the upper-right menu
4. Rename the exported file so it matches the corresponding file in this repository.
Do not edit any of the image references.
Although the images are tracked in this repo, they are not linked from the Markdown files.
(See below.)
5. Push your changed notebook to this repository.

TODO: In the future, it would make more sense to switch to the "Markdown-first" technique of using
GitHub as the golden store. To do this, we need to edit the Markdown files to remove Nextjournal
metadata and reference absolute GitHub URLs instad of Nextjournal URLs.
After that happens, please replace these instructions with reinstallation
instructions similar to those used for the "Learn Crux Datalog Today" tutorial:
