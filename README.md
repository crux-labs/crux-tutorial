## Install Tutorial on Nextjournal

The Quickstart is the easiest way to run the tutorial and you can use the Nextjournal
"Remix" feature to bring the tutorial into your own Nextjournal Clojure notebooks if you
like. However, you can import the Markdown files in this repository directly, if you would
prefer.

1. Create a new account on [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com).
2. Download a Markdown file from this repository root.
3. Click "+ NEW" to create a new notebook on the [Nextjournal Dashboard](https://nextjournal.com/dashboard).
4. At the bottom of the page, choose "Import: Select a Markdown file to import" and upload the `.md` file you downloaded in Step 2.
Do not use "Import from a (GitHub) URL" -- it will not work.
5. Once imported, scroll down to the EDN block which begins with `{:deps ...` under "Runtime Setup".
Hover your cursor over this EDN block and an ellipsis ("...") will appear on the lefthand side.
Click the ellipsis.
Choose "Assign Name" and enter `deps.edn`.
6. Open the Clojure Runtime Settings by clicking "Runtimes: Clojure" in the lefthand sidebar.
Scroll down to "Mounts" and click "+ Add mount".
Select `deps.edn`.
Click "Save changes and start" in the dialog that appears at the top.

You can now run the tutorial notebook.
